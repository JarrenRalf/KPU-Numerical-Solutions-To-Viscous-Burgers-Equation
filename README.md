# KPU-Numerical-Solutions-To-Viscous-Burgers-Equation
In my final year at KPU, I wrote a Bachelor's thesis pertaining to solving the viscous Burgers' equation using numerical methods.

What concepts did I learn?
- 

What soft skills did I learn?
- I was the only participant in this course so I figured out how learn and progress in an independent environment
- I learnt how to break down and understand accademic mathematical research papers
- I became more skilled at figuring out how to optimize time spent with a one-on-one mentor

What hard skills did I learn?
- I became better at Vectorization in MATLAB. Vectorization in MATLAB is a syntax for writing your code that takes advantage of the built in optimation MATLAB has for working with matrices and vecotrs.
